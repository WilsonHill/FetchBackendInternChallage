1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose to use Javascript and  Node.js with Express.js to develop the REST API because it is easy to intergrade the REST API into a full stack application if needed. I also used Postman for the requests to test the functionality of the REST API.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
An advantage is the simplicity of the code and it is scalable however in my solution there is no In-memory storage so that would be the first thing I would work on.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favorite project would have to be RxMeterics it is a program that provides pharmacies with critical metrics such as prescription counts, controlled substance statistics, weekly profit, and drug financial performance. It is currently utilized by three pharmacies. I implemented the solution using Python, pandas, and AWS.
